      <h2>Possible Bug in the Return of this Method in this C# Code</h2>
      <p>
        The possible bug in the provided method is that if no close date is found (i.e., if the dates array is empty), the method will return DateTime.MinValue, which represents the minimum possible value for a DateTime object. However, the requirement specifies that the method should return the current date if no close date is found.
      </p>
      <p>
        To address this issue, you can add a check after the loop to verify if closestDate still holds its initial value (which is DateTime.MinValue). If it does, you can set closestDate to the current date before returning it.
      </p>
    </div>
  );
